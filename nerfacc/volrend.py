    """Render the rays through the radience field defined by `rgb_sigma_fn`.

    This function is differentiable to the outputs of `rgb_sigma_fn` so it can
    be used for gradient-based optimization. It supports both batched and flattened input tensor.
    For flattened input tensor, both `ray_indices` and `n_rays` should be provided.


    Note:
        Either `rgb_sigma_fn` or `rgb_alpha_fn` should be provided.

    Warning:
        This function is not differentiable to `t_starts`, `t_ends` and `ray_indices`.

    Args:
        t_starts: Per-sample start distance. Tensor with shape (n_rays, n_samples) or (all_samples,).
        t_ends: Per-sample end distance. Tensor with shape (n_rays, n_samples) or (all_samples,).
        ray_indices: Ray indices of the flattened samples. LongTensor with shape (all_samples).
        n_rays: Number of rays. Only useful when `ray_indices` is provided.
        rgb_sigma_fn: A function that takes in samples {t_starts, t_ends,
            ray indices} and returns the post-activation rgb (..., 3) and density
            values (...,). The shape `...` is the same as the shape of `t_starts`.
        rgb_alpha_fn: A function that takes in samples {t_starts, t_ends,
            ray indices} and returns the post-activation rgb (..., 3) and opacity
            values (...,). The shape `...` is the same as the shape of `t_starts`.
        render_bkgd: Background color. Tensor with shape (3,).
        expected_depths: If True, return the expected depths. Else, the accumulated depth is returned.

    Returns:
        Ray colors (n_rays, 3), opacities (n_rays, 1), depths (n_rays, 1) and a dict

    filter out transparent samples. The function returns a boolean tensor indicating
    which samples are visible (`transmittance >= early_stop_eps` and `opacity >= alpha_thre`).

    This function supports both batched and flattened input tensor. For flattened input tensor, either
    (`packed_info`) or (`ray_indices` and `n_rays`) should be provided.

    Args:
        alphas: The opacity values of the samples. Tensor with shape (all_samples,) or (n_rays, n_samples).
        packed_info: A tensor of shape (n_rays, 2) that specifies the start and count
            of each chunk in the flattened samples, with in total n_rays chunks.
            Useful for flattened input.
        ray_indices: Ray indices of the flattened samples. LongTensor with shape (all_samples).
        n_rays: Number of rays. Only useful when `ray_indices` is provided.
        early_stop_eps: The early stopping threshold on transmittance.
        alpha_thre: The threshold on opacity.
        prefix_trans: The pre-computed transmittance of the samples. Tensor with shape (all_samples,).

    Returns:
        A boolean tensor indicating which samples are visible. Same shape as `alphas`.

    This function supports both batched inputs and flattened inputs with
    `ray_indices` and `n_rays` provided.

    Note:
        This function is differentiable to `weights` and `values`.

    Args:
        weights: Weights to be accumulated. If `ray_indices` not provided,
            `weights` must be batched with shape (n_rays, n_samples). Else it
            must be flattened with shape (all_samples,).
        values: Values to be accumulated. If `ray_indices` not provided,
            `values` must be batched with shape (n_rays, n_samples, D). Else it
            must be flattened with shape (all_samples, D). None means
            we accumulate weights along rays. Default: None.
        ray_indices: Ray indices of the samples with shape (all_samples,).
            If provided, `weights` must be a flattened tensor with shape (all_samples,)
            and values (if not None) must be a flattened tensor with shape (all_samples, D).
            Default: None.
        n_rays: Number of rays. Should be provided together with `ray_indices`. Default: None.

    Returns:
        Accumulated values with shape (n_rays, D). If `values` is not given we return
        the accumulated weights, in which case D == 1.
